Notes:	Can we make a plot of the verticies with epicenter? 
	Indicate depth of verticies on plot somehow?
	Auto generate event.xml and *_fault.txt?
	Compute strike/dip for simple planar segments?
	Check that verticies are specified in clockwise OR counterclockwise manner. 
	Require number of segments and number of verticies to be integers
	All longitude/latitudes must be in decimal degrees.
